So you start off at the front of a big forrest and you have to try and escape the forrest to get to the other side
where the treasure is that someone told you about (maybe add some lore if you can be arsed). The forest however, is
full of creatures and traps planted by evolution or people who used to live there

Gameplay mechanics:
battle system
inventory
24hr/day cycle
entering temples/ caves etc.
having decisions every hour for the player, based off of their state and position in the forrest
generate the forrests with some stuff

Enemies in the forrest:
Pixies
Spiders
Anthrapomorphic trees
Birds?

Other things in the forest:
Abandoned temples?
Some form of loot, each piece of loot has a value
Traps and stuff which you can fall into... or can fall onto you... or can fall at you... or kill you

Player:
health
money
hydration and hunger will both decrease with every turn, so you have another turn every hour or so in a day, and you sleep for 8 hours unless something happens in which case you will get sleep deprivation
the player dies if health, hydration, hunger and sleep deprivation all reach a critically low level
items like potions, weapons, food can all have certain values/ effects

Might implement pets... we'll see how we go
